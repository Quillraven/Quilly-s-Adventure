# QuillyJumper

This is a streaming project on twitch.tv/quillraven

We are going to develop a simple adventure using LibGDX, Kotlin and LibKTX extensions.
In addition we will use Tiled as a mapeditor, box2d as a physic engine and ashley as our entity component system.

If you want to use the framework, feel free to use it. I will try to update the [wiki](https://github.com/Quillraven/QuillyJumper/wiki) as best as possible so that you know, how to use it.

More information will follow once the project is growing a little bit bigger ;)
